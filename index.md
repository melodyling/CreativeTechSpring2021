## Week 2

### Reading Response
### Programming Design Systems

"There is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant."

I found this statement interesting as it speaks to designers' presumed responsibility adapting to new technologies and tools as a way of "staying relevant". Indeed, the languages of graphic design and other forms inevitably evolve with the emergence of new media and different affordances, and how people access content become different. However, I feel like designers should also not take a passive standpoint adapting to new digital realities whenever something new come out, but actively influence the emergences of these new media as intentional design choices as well.

“Design systems are especially interesting today, because digital products are systems, and designers who code are no longer confined to the creation of design systems that end up in printed manuals.”

It's interesting to see how digital products are inherently related to systems. As codes have logics and systems of their own, it is an excellent way to use the thinking in coding and apply it to the design of systems. To me, this kind of systematic thinking in code potentially pushes the movement of designing in systems as well. The emergence of digitized design systems, and coding systems such as p5 used in graphic languages are great examples.

"Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it is easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. […] However, once we have successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise explanation turns out to be worth it."

I just want to re-quote this one - the logic of designing a system of logic behind a thing is so much harder than designing a thing itself. However, it speaks largely to the resulting efficiency and seamless workflow that it turns out. In the age of mass production, this movement seems to be self-justifiable on its own.
