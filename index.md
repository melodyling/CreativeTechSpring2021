**Programming Design Systems**

>There is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.

I found this statement interesting as it speaks to designers' presumed responsibility adapting to new technologies and tools as a way of "staying relevant". Indeed, the languages of graphic design and other forms inevitably evolve with the emergence of new media and different affordances, and how people access content become different. However, I feel like designers should also not take a passive standpoint adapting to new digital realities whenever something new come out, but actively influence the emergences of these new media as intentional design choices as well.  

<br/>

>Design systems are especially interesting today, because digital products are systems, and designers who code are no longer confined to the creation of design systems that end up in printed manuals.

It's interesting to see how digital products are inherently related to systems. As codes have logics and systems of their own, it is an excellent way to use the thinking in coding and apply it to the design of systems. To me, this kind of systematic thinking in code potentially pushes the movement of designing in systems as well. The emergence of digitized design systems, and coding systems such as p5 used in graphic languages are great examples.  

<br/>

>Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it is easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. […] However, once we have successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise explanation turns out to be worth it.

I just want to re-quote this one - the logic of designing a system of logic behind a thing is so much harder than designing a thing itself. However, it speaks largely to the resulting efficiency and seamless workflow that it turns out. In the age of mass production, this movement seems to be self-justifiable on its own.

**You Look Like a Thing and I Love You**

>Sentiment-rating algorithms like this can learn to be biased. The common thread seems to be that if data comes from humans, it will likely have bias in it.

This sentence is really worth highlighting because a current common misperception is that AI is more objective or neutral than human decisions. However, in the end it falls back to the same place because the data from AI all come from human beings, so it is impossible to get rid of biases. What we can do is to acknowledge it as the first step.

<br/>

>People treat these kinds of algorithms as if they are making recommendations, but it’s a lot more accurate to say that they’re making predictions.

I think biased AI algorithms combining with predictions could be potentially a really dangerous thing, if used in important decision-making process. An example of this kind of threat is predictive policing, as the author mentioned. It is harmful in that the whole system reinforces existing human biases, as AI is unconsciously learning from past human biases and mistakes, and build them into its own system. This ends up creating a feedback loop that creates social hierarchies.

<br/>

>The bias is still there, because the AI copied it from its training data, but now it’s wrapped in a layer of hard-to-interpret AI behavior.

Another part of why AI bias is always so hard to overcome is that there is always a blackbox within the huge amount of data and ways of training. Therefore, I also feel like we need to aim for a level of more transparency, and design for a better means of data collection.

## Project 1 Reflection

This is an interesting project to me as it's the first time I see the web having the ability to create something more aesthetic/mechanical/illogical instead of functional, and I see the beauty within it. At the same time, as internet connects people at their fingertips instantly in an unprecedented way, I find the concept of individual in relation to the larger world worth of more exploration. As we connect world news and weather with individual's emotional journey, I found the individual within a larger context more so than ever in that there's a subtle relation between them that is situational, even in a chaotic way that doesn't make sense.

# Week 4

## Reading Response
**Notes on Failure**

>If despair is - as I believe it to be - as absurd a state of the soul as euphoria, who can protest that it feels more substantial, more reliable, less out of scale with the human environment-? When it was observed to T. S. Eliot that most critics are failed writers, Eliot replied: "But so are most writers."

I simply love the language of Joyce Carol Oates after reading this, in that she explains the process of creation as a form of internal energy in a beautiful way. I love how she compares despair with euphoria as both possessing an excessive amount of energy, and it is this form of energy itself that pushes one to contiue writing and creation. It is almost existential in a way that it speaks so fundamentally towards a naturally ontological state of human beings - that failure is creation itself.

<br/>

>In this, the art of reading hardly differs from the art of writing, in that its most intense pleasures and pains must remain private, and cannot be communicated to others. Our secret affinities remain secret even to ourselves... we fall in love with certain works of art, as we fall in love with certain individuals, for no very clear motive.

After reading this I am really keen on learning more on the critical theory of emotions - how they become a driving force towards one's identity and how it creates interesting tensions towards the opposition / inversion between social relationships. Looks like there's always a tension between the most authentic self and "the others", because we long for the ultimate understanding at the same time when we are fearful of being exposed from privacy. To me, art and writing are always channels for expression to reconcile this contradiction.

<br/>

>This insatiable desire to write something before I die, this ravaging sense of the shortness and feverishness of life, make me cling ... to my one anchor.

I just want to highlight this quote from Virginia Woolf.. so beautifully written.
